# Avengers-invisble-cloak

## Inspiration
As I am a super fan of Avengers, I was thinking to create something that can make me feel like even I am with them

## What it does
So it is an invisible cloak that uses Artificial Intelligence for presenting the user with Avengers

## How we built it
It's built-in Python, Numpy & OpenCV

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It worked perfectly as I thought and made me feel like an avenger üòÅ
